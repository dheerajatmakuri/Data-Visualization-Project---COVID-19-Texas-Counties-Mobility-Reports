Project Title - ‘Texas Mobility Insights: Navigating the Impact of COVID-19 Policies’

Project Overview: This project focuses on evaluating the impacts of COVID-19 policies on human mobility within Texas, targeting specific counties such as Anderson, Dallas, Denton, and others. By harnessing anonymized data from Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, this study delves into daily changes in people’s movements to various locations, aiming to understand the behavioral shifts due to pandemic-related measures.

Objectives: The primary objective is to analyze how various COVID-19 containment measures, such as lockdowns and social distancing mandates, have influenced how individuals work, live, and move within their communities in Texas. This analysis seeks to offer insights into the effectiveness of these public health strategies.

Hypothesis: The project posits several hypotheses related to changes in mobility patterns across Texas Counties from 2020 to 2022, focusing on workplaces, grocery and pharmacy visits, park visits, public transit use, and residential stay durations. Key findings include a 20% increase in workplace commuting in 2021 and significant changes in retail and recreation activities, indicating shifts in public behavior in response to the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.

Data Sources and Methodology: The data for this analysis is derived from Google’s Community Mobility Reports, which track movement trends over time by geography. Metrics such as changes from a baseline in retail, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential areas are examined. The project utilizes a combination of Excel for data cleansing and Tableau for data visualization, enabling effective data manipulation and insightful graphical presentations.

Key Findings
•	Workplace Mobility: A noticeable increase in people returning to physical workplaces in 2021, suggesting a rebound in economic activities as restrictions eased.
•	Retail and Recreation: Improvements were seen in the number of people visiting grocery stores and pharmacies, reflecting a restoration of consumer confidence as the pandemic progressed.
•	Park Visitation: There was a substantial increase in park visits in 2021, likely due to the public seeking outdoor activities after periods of stringent lockdowns.
•	Public Transit: While there was a slight improvement in public transit use from 2021 to 2022, the figures still reflect a cautious return to public transportation.
